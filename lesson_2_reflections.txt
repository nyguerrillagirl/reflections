What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

Running the git command "git init" initialize a repository. That is, hidden directory
is created name .git containing all the metadata Git uses to manage our new 
repository.


How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area contains the set of files "to be committed" or "added" to the repository. So the file in its current state
is not yet in the repository if it is in the staging area. The working directory contains the current set of
files that you are working on and may not be the same set of files in the working area or repository.
